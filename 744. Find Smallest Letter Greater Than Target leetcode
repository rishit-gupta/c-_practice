You are given an array of characters letters that is sorted in non-decreasing order, and a character target. There are at least two different characters in letters.

Return the smallest character in letters that is lexicographically greater than target. If such a character does not exist, return the first character in letters.

 

Example 1:

Input: letters = ["c","f","j"], target = "a"
Output: "c"
Explanation: The smallest character that is lexicographically greater than 'a' in letters is 'c'.



class Solution {
public:
    char nextGreatestLetter(vector<char>& letters, char target) {
        int left = 0;
        int right = letters.size() - 1;

        while (left <= right) {
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
            if (letters[mid] <= target) {
                left = mid + 1;
            } else {
                right = mid - 1;
            }
        }

        return left < letters.size() ? letters[left] : letters[0];
    }
};
