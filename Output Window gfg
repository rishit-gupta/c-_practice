Given a positive integer N, print count of set bits in it. 

Example 1:

Input:
N = 6
Output:
2
Explanation:
Binary representation is '110' 
So the count of the set bit is 2.



class Solution {
  public:
    int setBits(int N) {
        // Write Your Code here
        int count=0;
        while(N>0){
            if(N%2==1)
            count++;
            
            N=N/2;
        }
        return count;
    }
};
