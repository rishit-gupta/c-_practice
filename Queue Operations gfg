Given N integers, the task is to insert those elements in the queue. Also, given M integers, the task is to find the frequency of each number in the Queue.
Note:

insert() will be called N times by main().
findFrequency() will be called M times by main();
Where k is each element passing through respective function calls.
Example 1:

Input:
N = 8
1 2 3 4 5 2 3 1
M = 5
1 3 2 9 10
Output:
2
2
2
-1
-1
Explanation:
After inserting 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 2, 3 and 1 into the queue, frequency of 1 is 2, 3 is 2 and 2 is 2. Since 9 and 10 are not there in the queue we output -1 for them.
class Solution{
    public:
    // Function to insert element into the queue
 
    void insert(queue<int> &q, int k){
        // Your code here
        q.push(k);
     
    }
    
    // Function to find frequency of an element
    // return the frequency of k
    int findFrequency(queue<int> &q, int k){
        // Your code here
      queue<int>p;
      int ans=0;
      while(!q.empty()){
          p.push(q.front());
          if(q.front()==k) ans++;
          q.pop();
      }
      q=p;
      return ans;
    }
    
};
