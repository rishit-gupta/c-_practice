Given an array nums of integers, return the length of the longest arithmetic subsequence in nums.

Note that:

A subsequence is an array that can be derived from another array by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.
A sequence seq is arithmetic if seq[i + 1] - seq[i] are all the same value (for 0 <= i < seq.length - 1).
 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [3,6,9,12]
Output: 4
Explanation:  The whole array is an arithmetic sequence with steps of length = 3.

class Solution {
public:
    int longestArithSeqLength(vector<int>& nums) {
        int n = nums.size();
        if (n <= 2)
            return n;

        int longest = 2;
        vector<unordered_map<int, int>> dp(n);

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < i; j++) {
                int diff = nums[i] - nums[j];
                dp[i][diff] = dp[j].count(diff) ? dp[j][diff] + 1 : 2;
                longest = max(longest, dp[i][diff]);
            }
        }

        return longest;
    }
};
