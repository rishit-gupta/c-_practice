Given a binary tree, find its maximum depth.
A binary tree's maximum depth is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.

Example 1:

Input:
 root  -->     1
             /   \
            3     2
           /
          4           
Output: 3
Explanation:
Maximum depth is between nodes 1 and 4, which is 3.
class Solution{
  public:
    /*You are required to complete this method*/
    int maxDepth(Node *root) {
        // Your code here
        if(!root)
            return 0;
        return 1+max(maxDepth(root->left),maxDepth(root->right));
    }
};
