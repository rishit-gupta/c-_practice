You start with an array A of size N. Initially all elements of the array A are zero. You will be given K positive integers. Let j be one of these integers, you have to add 1 to all A[i], where i â‰¥ j. Your task is to print the array A after all these K updates are done.

Note: 1-based indexing is followed for updates.

Example 1:

Input:
N = 3, K = 4
1 1 2 3
Output:
2 3 4
Explanation:
Initially the array is {0, 0, 0}. After the
first 1, it becomes {1, 1, 1}. After the
second 1 it becomes {2, 2, 2}. After 2, 
it becomes {2, 3, 3} and 
After 3 it becomes, {2, 3, 4}.


class Solution{
    public:
    void update(int a[], int n, int updates[], int k)
    {
        // Your code goes here
        for(int i=0;i<k;i++)
        {
            a[updates[i]-1]++;
        }
        int sum = 0;
        for(int i=0;i<n;i++)
        {
            sum=sum+a[i];
            a[i] = sum;
            
        }
    }
};
