Given a number in its binary form find if the given binary number is a multiple of 3. It is recommended to finish the task using one traversal of input binary number.

Example 1:

Input: S = "0011"
Output: 1
Explanation: "0011" is 3, which is divisible by 3.




class Solution{
public:	
		
	int isDivisible(string s){
	    vector<vector<int>> v={{0,1},{2,0},{1,2}};
	    int cur=0;
	    for(auto c:s) {
	        cur=v[cur][c-'0'];
	    }
	    return cur==0;
	}

};
